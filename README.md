## About this project

This project is an example of how to integrate the [Timm49/similar-content](https://github.com/Timm49/similar-content) package into a Laravel project.

This example focuses on how to use the package to easily add a "Related items recommendation" section to a detail view.
It's a very basic app with news articles like NYT, CNN, etc.
It includes a command which uses the New York Times RSS feed to populate the database with dummy data.
An example of the recommendation section can be found on an article detail route: /articles/{slug}

## Contributing

This is just an example app so I don't expect too many contributions. Feel free of course.
