# Development Rules and Standards

## Tech Stack
- Laravel 12
- Vue 3 with Inertia.js
- Tailwind CSS
- PHPUnit for testing
- TDD approach

## 1. Development Guidelines

### Laravel & PHP
- Use PHP 8.2+ features where appropriate
- Follow Laravel conventions and best practices
- Prefer using helpers over facades when possible
- Use type hints and return types consistently
- Leverage Laravel's built-in features before adding external packages
- Use dependency injection over static calls
- Follow SOLID principles

### Vue & Inertia
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Leverage Inertia's built-in features for navigation and state management
- Use Vue's built-in transition components for animations
- Follow Vue's style guide and best practices

### Testing
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
- Use PHPUnit for backend tests
- Use Vitest for frontend tests
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use factories and seeders for test data
- Mock external services and APIs
- Use feature tests for critical user flows
- Use unit tests for business logic

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use Tailwind's built-in dark mode support
- Keep custom CSS to a minimum
- Use Tailwind's @apply directive sparingly
- Follow consistent spacing and sizing

## 2. Coding Standards and Conventions

### PHP
- File names: Use PascalCase (e.g., `ArticleController.php`)
- Class names: Use PascalCase (e.g., `ArticleController`)
- Method names: Use camelCase (e.g., `getArticle`)
- Variable names: Use camelCase (e.g., `$articleTitle`)
- Constants: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_ARTICLES`)
- Properties: Use camelCase (e.g., `$publishedAt`)

### Vue
- Component files: Use PascalCase (e.g., `ArticleCard.vue`)
- Component names: Use PascalCase (e.g., `ArticleCard`)
- Props: Use camelCase (e.g., `articleTitle`)
- Events: Use kebab-case (e.g., `@article-clicked`)
- Methods: Use camelCase (e.g., `handleClick`)
- Computed properties: Use camelCase (e.g., `formattedDate`)

### Database
- Table names: Use snake_case, plural (e.g., `articles`)
- Column names: Use snake_case (e.g., `published_at`)
- Foreign keys: Use singular table name with `_id` suffix (e.g., `user_id`)
- Index names: Use descriptive names with table prefix (e.g., `articles_published_at_index`)

## 3. Project Structure

├── Models/
├── Services/
├── Jobs/
└── Enums/
```

### Frontend

```

### Tests

```

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests
- Feature tests for API endpoints and controllers
- Unit tests for services and business logic
- Database tests for models and relationships
- Job tests for background processes

### Frontend Tests
- Component tests for Vue components
- Page tests for Inertia pages
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths

## 5. Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Use PHPDoc blocks for classes and methods
- Document complex business logic
- Keep comments up to date
- Use type hints and return types

### Project Documentation
- Keep README.md updated
- Document setup and installation steps
- Include usage examples
- Document environment variables
- Keep API documentation current

## 6. Git Workflow

### Branch Naming
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/description`
- Releases: `release/version`

### Commit Messages
- Use present tense
- Start with a verb
- Keep it concise
- Reference issue numbers

### Pull Requests
- Include description of changes
- Reference related issues
- Include test coverage
- Request reviews from team members
